**Student interaction and cognition in online role playing discussions**

This study describes evidence supporting the effectiveness of role playing discussion for science
communication in online education and offers strategies for its implementation The effectiveness of role
playing discussions was assessed through three measures 1 student perceptions of the activity, 2 student
interaction using the Interaction Analysis Model, and 3 level of cognition using the Revised Bloomâ€™s
Taxonomy The results demonstrated that students were highly engaged in this activity, with limited presence
of off topic threads In addition, students adjusted the cognitive level of their participation as they embodied
different roles and performed at high levels of cognition Role playing enables rich and adaptable online
discussions, facilitating peer learning in distant settings
