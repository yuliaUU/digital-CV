Since I was five, I have been very interested in marine conservation, especially in the conservation of sharks. In the summer of 2011, I was accepted to the Great White Shark Internship in South Africa (Mossel Bay). I worked under the supervision of Dr. Enrico Gennari and Dr. Ryan Johnson (founders of the ‘Oceans Research’ organization). During my stay, I was involved with such projects as photo ID of great white sharks and bottlenose dolphins, genetic sampling, measurement of the dissolved oxygen in the coastal region of Mossel Bay, and survey on seal-shark interaction. Other projects investigated the learning ability of benthic sharks and population analysis of dolphins and whales in the bay.
