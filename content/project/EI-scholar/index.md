**Project Vision:** *Using the tools and suggested best practices for learning activities this project will produce, other educators will be able to better understand and respond to the diverse needs of students in their specific disciplinary contexts.*

**Goals:**

- Develop tools for educators and researchers to measure aspects of the classroom  relevant to EDI
    - Classroom Climate Assessment Tool (CCAT) to assess studentsâ€™ perceptions of  classroom climate (discipline-agnostic)
    - Course Affective Outcome Questionnaire (CAOQ) to measure pre- and post-course affective outcomes (e.g, self-efficacy) and correlate these with course experiences (may need to have discipline-specific versioning to ensure we measure affective changes related to specific courses)
- Identify the inequities and inequalities that currently exist in our active-learning  Science courses
    - Set of relevant demographic questions to include in each survey tool to aid in data interpretation and allow for comparisons between student subpopulations 
    - Report on differences to survey responses based on demographic category in current survey data
- Determine the characteristics of learning activities that support and engage all students
    - Learning Activities Questionnaire (LAQ) to measure pre-course and post-course experiences with classroom learning activities and perception of academic self-concept (also includes academic self-concept)
    - Suggested best practices for implementing learning activities in UBC introductory Science courses
