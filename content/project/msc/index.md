My Master’s project was to investigate the early marine stage in the population of juvenile sockeye salmon in Rivers Inlet (BC, Canada) during their outmigration to the Pacific Ocean. Specifically, my research focused on the understanding the effect of climate change on the physiological state of juvenile sockeye. Predictive models, obtained in my research, were able to predict the state of the fish based on the environmental parameters and size of the fish at entry into marine environment. These findings may be very useful for fisheries managers as a tool that may help to improve the return estimates. In addition, the one of the major component of my study was chemical analysis of salmon otolith on LA-ICP/MS.
